* The anvil, what a nice addition ... back in 1.4. Sadly overtime the Anvil became too much expensive to use, and also players realized that wasn't that good: the repair cap, experience not begin easy to obtain ... and even if Mojang tried to balance it through the years, they admitted defeat when in 1.9 they added this: Mending. With this, lots of things made the requirement of new gear no longer needed. Why would I spend time making a new chestplate, when I can just AFK fish, get mending and then go *XP pickup sound*
* I've been developing a mod, called Survival Reimagined, a mod that tries to bring back the old Survival aspect of minecraft, without going too realistic ... I'm looking at you terrafirmacraft. This mod, among many other features, changes the Anvil, experience and enchantments.
* First off, Mending is removed, no longer exists, and actually it's no longer needed.
* To make up for this removal, anvil repairing has been changed.
  * Items no longer stack up cost ... you know, that cost that doubles each time you repair an item in an anvil, instead the cost to repair them is fixed and based off enchantments on the gear. So an item with no enchantments can be repaired for free.
  * You may ask "What about netherite? It's a pain to obtain and without mending would be an even bigger pain". Don't fear my fellow miner, me, Insane, have got you covered. Netherite equipment can now be repaired partially with Diamonds, up to 75% durability. This means that only 1 Netherite ingot is required to fully repair equipment.
  * Plus, as a bonus, renaming an item is free
* Now, let's talk about experience
  * Experience has three major changes: the level curve, death and XP obtained

  * Plus, as a bonus, picking up XP is now faster
