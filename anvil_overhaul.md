* The anvil, what a nice addition ... back in 1.4. Mojang also tried to balance it through the years, but admitting defeat when in 1.9 they added this: Mending. With this, lots of things "ruined" the game, from Trading halls to auto fishing farms, rendering the make of new gear useless
* I've been developing a mod, called Survival Reimagined. This mod, among many other features, has got many changes to the Anvil and XP in general.
* First off, Mending is removed, no longer exists, and actually it's no longer needed.
