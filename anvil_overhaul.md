* The anvil, what a nice addition ... back in 1.4. Mojang also tried to balance it through the years, but admitting defeat when in 1.9 they added this: Mending. With this, lots of things "ruined" the game, from Trading halls to auto fishing farms, rendering the make of new gear useless
* I've been developing a mod, called Survival Reimagined. This mod, among many other features, has got many changes to the Anvil and XP in general.
* First off, Mending is removed, no longer exists, and actually it's no longer needed.
* To fill this gap, anvil repairing has been changed.
  * Items no longer stack up cost ... you know, that cost that doubles each time you repair an item in an anvil, instead the cost to repair them is fixed and based off enchantments on the gear. So an item with no enchantments can be repaired for free.
  * You may ask "What about netherite?", that's a pain to obtain
